  <h1>Loners.company is a collective of designers, programmers, and artists. Our most important value is cooperation, which allows us to do great things together. Everything we create comes from an internal discussion about ethical principles and the comprehensibility of design. We mainly work for public and art institutions, architects, and artists. We are always open to collaboration.</h1>
